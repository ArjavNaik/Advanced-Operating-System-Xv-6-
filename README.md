# Advanced-Operating-System-Xv-6
Contents of the two file in brief
- Implemented Stride Schedular which is a deterministic fair-share scheduler instead of the default Round-Robin Schedular in XV6 Kernel and observed the performance improvement in terms of time taken by a process in both cases. 
- Made a Thread Library for XV-6 as it does not have an inbuilt thread library. The included functions were thread_create, lock_init, lock_acquire and lock_release. And also tested the functionality of the library using various test cases.
